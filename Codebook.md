Codebook
=================

This is the Codebook for the final dataset contained in `final_dataset.txt`,  generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

This Codebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Column descriptions for the final dataset
2. Column filters applied to initial downloaded data 
3. Is the final dataset tidy?
4. Raw Data collection and variables estimations  

###2. Column descriptions for the final dataset
The final dataset has 72 columns:

* 1 Column = called `Activity`
* 1 Column =  called `Subject`
* 70 Columns = Summary Means for 70 variables, called `SummaryMean_ variable name`

`Activity`: describes the activity perfomed during the experiment; it is descriptive and in R 
is implemented as Factor w/ 6 levels: 
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIR
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

`Subject`: identifies the individual (aka Subject) who is performing the Activity; it is a numeric id which
ranges from 1 to 30; in R is implemented as an int =  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...30
As expected, in the final set there are 180 rows, because there are 6 activities and 30 subjects, so 6x30 = 180.
    
`SummaryMean_ variable name`: All the remaining 70 columns are computed means; they all have the prefix `SummaryMean_` to indicate that they ares summary means of the variables whose names are captured in the character string that follows the prefix. For Example:
    
`SummaryMean_ tBodyAcc-mean()-X` is the calculated summary mean of `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` by Activity by Subject

###2. Column filters applied to initial downloaded data 
The final dataset created by the R script named `run_analysis.R`, is intended to be an independent tidy data set with the `average of each variable for each activity and each subject`.

The project requested only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. So the script extracts only the columns containing `Subject|Activity|std|mean`. 
The function used in the script is case sensitive and excludes the occurrenes of upper case `Mean`, which is used in the `angle` columns which I do not want anyways because the mean is a parameter. As a result, the following columns are excluded:

* angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)        
* angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean) 
* angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)     
* angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean) 
* angle(X,gravityMean)                 
* angle(Y,gravityMean)                 
* angle(Z,gravityMean) 

I also decided to exclude the following 9 columns, as they contain "Body" twice and I do not think they make sense:

 * fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()
 * fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()        
 * fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-meanFreq()  
 * fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()        
 * fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()           
 * fBodyBodyGyroMag-meanFreq() 
 * fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()    
 * fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()      
 * fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq() 

After these filters the number of features which were initially 561 decreased to 70.

###3. Is the final dataset tidy?
As David Hood points out in one of the discussion forums the `"tidy for"` principle is hard to apply here because we don't have a specific problem to apply it to.

However, the final daset satisfies the checklist suggested by David in the 
Tidy data thread at [https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/forum/thread?thread_id=31](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/forum/thread?thread_id=31):

1. The final dataset has headings so that I know which columns are which; the string headings are compact and I like the way they are built because you can actuallly infer what they mean with the abbreviations used; the recipe is given in section 4, sourced from feauture_info.txt; some examples:

*  all the variable names have a `t` or an `f` the beginning, distinguishing bewteen the time or frequency domain
*  the feature name follows immediately the prefix `t` or `f`
*  the measurement type (example: mean() or std()) always follows the variable name
*  when applicable, the variable names terminates with X or Y or Z to specify the axial direction of the signal

2. The variables are in different columns  
3. There are no duplicate columns (I programmatically checked with `dup<-duplicated(tt_subset_summary[,1:72])` )

Now, I do not know if the data is correct, i.e. if the values are meaningful.
I checked there are no N/A's with `sapply(tt_subset_summary , function(x)all(is.na(x)))`

###4. Raw Data collection and variables estimations   

Source: `feautures_info.ext`

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals `tAcc-XYZ` and `tGyro-XYZ`. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (`tBodyAcc-XYZ` and `tGravityAcc-XYZ`) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (`tBodyAccJerk-XYZ` and `tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ`). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (`tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag`). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing `fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag`. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions:

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* mad(): Median absolute deviation 
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
* iqr(): Interquartile range 
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
* kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of 561 variables of each feature vector is in 'features.txt'.

I observed there are duplicate column names although the values are different. I am not including the analysis because the assignment is asking to focus on other columns.
