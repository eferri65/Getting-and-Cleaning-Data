Codebook
=================

This is the Codebook for the final dataset in `final_dataset.txt` generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

This Codebook is divided into the following sections:

1. Description of the final dataset
2. Is the final dataset tidy?
3. Evolution from Raw Data to final dataset; some information is sourced from  `feautures_info.ext`

###1. Description of the final dataset
The final dataset is created by `run_analysis.R` script following the assignment instruction of step 5, which requires to create an independent tidy data set with the 'average of each variable for each activity and each subject'.

As expected, there are 180 rows, becauase there are 6 activities and 30 subjects, so 6x30 = 180.
There are 81 columns, acoording to the following breakdown:

* 1 Column = calles `Activity`
* 1 Column =  called `Subject`
* 79 Columns = Summary Means for 79 variables, called `SummaryMean_ variable name`

`Activity`: describes the activity perfomed during the experiment; it is descriptive and in R 
is implemented as Factor w/ 6 levels: 
1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIR
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

`Subject`: identifies the individual (aka Subject) who is performing the Activity; it is a numeric id which
ranges from 1 to 30; in R is implemented as an int =  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...30
    
`SummaryMean_ variable name`: All the remaining 79 columns are computed means; they all have the prefix `SummaryMean_` to indicate that they ares ummary means of the variable names captured in the character string that follows the prefix. For Example:
    
`SummaryMean_ tBodyAcc-mean()-X` is the calculated summary mean of `tBodyAcc-mean()-X` by Activity by Subject
    
Find below the definitions of the variable names for which the SummaryMean_ are computed; they all are num:

###3. Evolution from Raw Data to final dataset; some information is sourced from  `feautures_info.ext`


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions:

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* mad(): Median absolute deviation 
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
* iqr(): Interquartile range 
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
* kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of 561 variables of each feature vector is in 'features.txt'
