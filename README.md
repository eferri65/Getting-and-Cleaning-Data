# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
===========

As required, I submitted the following files:

1. This Readme markdown file
2. An R script named run_analysis.R
3. A markdown file called Codebook
4. The output of the R script
 

###Instructions on how to run the script named run_analysis.R





* Scientific collaborators who need statisticians to analyze data for them
* Students or postdocs in scientific disciplines looking for consulting advice
* Junior statistics students whose job it is to collate/clean data sets
 

The first function, `makeVector` creates a special "vector", which is
really a list containing a function to


1.  set the value of the vector
2.  get the value of the vector
3.  set the value of the mean
4.  get the value of the mean

<!-- -->

    makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
            m <- NULL
            set <- function(y) {
                    x <<- y
                    m <<- NULL
            }
            get <- function() x
            setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
            getmean <- function() m
            list(set = set, get = get,
                 setmean = setmean,


                 getmean = getmean)
    }

The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector"
created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
mean has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the
cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of
the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setmean`
function.

    cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
            m <- x$getmean()
            if(!is.null(m)) {
                    message("getting cached data")
                    return(m)
            }
            data <- x$get()
            m <- mean(data, ...)
            x$setmean(m)
            m
    }

### Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

 

1.  `makeCacheMatrix`: This function creates a special "matrix" object
    that can cache its inverse.
2.  `cacheSolve`: This function computes the inverse of the special
    "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
    already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then
    `cacheSolve` should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the `solve`
function in R. For example, if `X` is a square invertible matrix, then
`solve(X)` returns its inverse.

For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always
invertible.

In order to complete this assignment, you must do the following:

1.  Fork the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at
    [https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2)
    to create a copy under your own account.
2.  Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can
    edit the files locally on your own machine.
3.  Edit the R file contained in the git repository and place your
    solution in that file (please do not rename the file).
4.  Commit your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your
    git branch to the GitHub repository under your account.
5.  Submit to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains
    the completed R code for the assignment.
