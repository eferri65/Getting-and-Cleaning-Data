Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
===========

As required, I submitted the following files:

1. This `Readme` markdown file
2. An R script named `run_analysis.R`
3. A markdown file called `Codebook`
4. The output of the R script called `final_dataset`
 
###Instructions on how to run the script named run_analysis.R

*Assumptions: 

1. Ensure you are using the same file structure as the `UCI HAR Dataset` dowloaded for the assignment
2. Set your working directory at the top level of the `UCI HAR Dataset`, which the script will assign to be the root directory
 
*To run the script:

<!-- -->
    1. step 1: load(run_analysis.R)
    2. step 2: run_analysis.R
    3. step 3: the file will generate a file called final_dataset.txt

*why the data is tydy
